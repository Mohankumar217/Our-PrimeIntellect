FROZEN LAKE VLM ENVIRONMENT: STATUS REPORT
==========================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
I have successfully implemented the "VLM-Style" architecture for FrozenLake, adhering strictly to the Prime-Intellect ideology. The agent now perceives its world through **RGB Images** rather than text descriptions.

The core loop `Observe -> Reason -> Act` functions seamlessly with a mock VLM, demonstrating the viability of the pipeline.

2. DETAILED ACCOMPLISHMENTS
---------------------------
(A) Visual Modality Implementation
    - Created `FrozenLakeRenderer` (PIL-based).
    - Agent, Holes, and Goal are visually distinct.
    - Verified via `demo_renderer.py` (generated 4 sample frames).

(B) Multimodal Infrastructure
    - Implemented `VLMWrapper` to handle Image+Text prompts.
    - Integrated `XMLParser` to enforce strict output formatting.
    - Structure allows generic VLM APIs to be plugged in easily.

(C) Selection-Based Learning Architecture
    - Implemented `run_agent.py`.
    - Strategies are saved to `memory.json` only upon success.
    - Bad episodes are discarded (Evolution by Selection).

3. TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT
-----------------------
State of Environment: READY FOR INTEGRATION
    - Physics: Unchanged from LLM version (Stable).
    - Rendering: Verified (Clear distinct colors).
    - Pipeline: Verified (End-to-End loop functional).

State of Agents: MOCK
    - Currently using a random-action mock model for verification.
    - Next step is to plug in a real VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL, GPT-4o, Gemini-Vision).

4. NEXT OBJECTIVES
------------------
1. **Model Integration**: Replace `mock_vlm_model` with a real API call.
2. **Visual Memory**: Update memory format to reference specific image hashes or embeddings for better recall.
3. **Scale**: Run 100+ episodes to allow a real VLM to discover the path via selection.
