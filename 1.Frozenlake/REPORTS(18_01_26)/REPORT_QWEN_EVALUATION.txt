1. OBJECTIVE
------------
To evaluate the performance of a local model (`Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`) on the FrozenLake reasoning task.

2. PROBLEM HISTORY
------------------
A. PHASE 1: Hallucinated XML structure (Fixed by Parser/Prompt hardening).
B. PHASE 2: "Invalid Action" hallucinations (`FORWARD`, `TURN_LEFT`) despite negative constraints.

3. FINAL MITIGATION (PHASE 3: MANUAL PROMPT FIX)
------------------------------------------------
The System Prompt was manually updated to include a positive constraint list:
> "You have only four actions: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN."

4. FINAL RESULTS (PHASE 3)
--------------------------
We conducted a verification run with this change.

- **Step 0**: `START GAME. GO LEFT.` (Invalid Format).
  - The model initially ignored the XML instruction, likely distracted by the new text.
- **Step 1**: `<action>LEFT</action>` (VALID).
  - The model recovered and output a valid, allowed action.
- **Step 2**: `<Action>UP</Action>` (VALID).
  - The model continued to output valid actions.

5. CONCLUSION
-------------
The manual addition of the explicit positive constraint ("You have only four actions...") proved **MORE EFFECTIVE** than negative constraints ("Do NOT use...").
- It eliminated the `FORWARD` / `TURN` hallucinations.
- Trade-off: Slight instability in formatting (Step 0 failure), but the agent recovered.

**Status**: The agent is now playable, though performance (reasoning to reach the goal) remains limited by the 1.5B model size.
