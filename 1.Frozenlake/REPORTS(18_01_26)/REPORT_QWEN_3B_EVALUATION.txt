REPORT: QWEN AGENT EVALUATION (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct)

================================================================================

1. OBJECTIVE
------------
To evaluate the upgraded `Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` model on the FrozenLake reasoning task, comparing it to the 1.5B version.

2. CONFIGURATION
----------------
- Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
- Setup: Same as previous (Manual Prompt Fix + Hardened Parser)
- Episodes: 1 (Verification Run)

3. RESULTS
----------
A. INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING (SUCCESS)
   - Unlike the 1.5B model, the 3B model **perfectly adhered** to the XML format and action constraints.
   - Step 0: `<action>RIGHT</action>` (Valid)
   - Step 1: `<action>DOWN</action>` (Valid Format)
   - No hallucinations, no "Invalid Action" errors, no verbose XML dumps.

B. REASONING CAPABILITY (FAILURE)
   - While valid in *form*, the agent failed in *strategy*.
   - Path Taken: (0,0) -> RIGHT -> (0,1) -> DOWN -> (1,1) [HOLE]
   - The agent walked directly into a known hole, despite the System Prompt listing (1,1) as a DANGER zone.

4. CONCLUSION
-------------
- **Infrastructure**: Verified robust. The prompt/parser issues are solved.
- **Model**: The 3B model solves the *alignment/instruction-following* problem of the 1.5B model but still lacks the zero-shot *spatial reasoning* capability to play the game optimally without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or fine-tuning.

5. RECOMMENDATION
-----------------
To achieve a "Win", we likely need:
1. **Chain of Thought**: Force the model to "think" before acting (e.g., `<thought>...</thought><action>...</action>`).
2. **Context Examples**: Add successful episode examples (Few-Shot) to the prompt.
